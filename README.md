# Cangjie Language Command Line Toolchain(beta feature)

## Introduction

This warehouse provides the Cangjie language command-line toolchain, which includes project management tools, formatting tools, multilingual bridging tools, and language service tools. Developers can use it through the command line or integrate it into DevEco Studio.

## System Architecture

The overall architecture diagram of the Cangjie toolchain is as follows:

As shown in the diagram, this warehouse provides the following cangjie tools:

- Cangjie Project Manager （Abbreviated as `cjpm`）：used for managing the module system of Cangjie project, covering module initialization, dependency checking and updating operations, providing a unified compilation entry point, supporting incremental compilation, parallel compilation, etc.
- Cangjie Formatter （Abbreviated as `cjfmt`）: a code automatic formatting tool developed based on the Cangjie programming specification.
- Cangjie HyperLang Extension （Abbreviated as `hle`）: cangjie calls the template auto generation tool for ArkTS interoperability code.
- Cangjie Languager Server （Abbreviated as `lsp`）: the server backend that provides Cangjie language services on the DevEco Studio needs to be used in conjunction with the DevEco Studio client.

Cangjie Language CLI Toolchain currently supports the following platforms: Windows x86-64, Linux x86-64/AArch64, Mac x86/arm64. OpenHarmony platform is under development.
