# HLE Tool Development Guide

## System Architecture

`HLE (HyperlangExtension)` is an automated code template generation tool for Cangjie-ArkTS interoperability.  
The tool takes ArkTS interface declaration files (e.g., files with `.d.ts` or `.d.ets` extensions) as input and outputs a directory containing `BUILD.gn` files and an `src` folder. The `src` folder contains generated interoperability code in `.cj` files. The tool also outputs a JSON file containing all ArkTS file information. The overall technical architecture is shown below:

![HLE Architecture Diagram](../figures/HLE_eng.png)

As shown in the architecture diagram:

Interface Layer:

- ArkTS Language Interface Parsing: Parses the input ArkTS interface declaration file, extracting various information about the interface, such as definition, parameters, return values, etc. This provides the basic interface metadata for subsequent generation of interoperability code, serving as the starting parsing step of the entire code generation process.

Framework Layer:

- Interface Abstract Description Generation: Based on the parsed ArkTS interface, the interface information is abstracted to create a unified and concise abstract description of the interface, facilitating subsequent operations like interface dependency analysis, and providing a clear abstract model for handling interface relations during the code generation process.
- Interface Dependency Analysis: Analyzes the dependency relationships between various ArkTS interfaces, clarifying the order of calls, dependency conditions, etc., ensuring that the generated interoperability code is logically correct, can properly handle dependencies between interfaces, and guarantees the executability of the code.
- Type Conversion: Since there may be different data type systems between Cangjie and ArkTS, this part is responsible for converting data types between the two environments, ensuring that data types correctly match when Cangjie calls ArkTS or when ArkTS returns data to Cangjie, thus avoiding errors caused by type incompatibility.
- Exception Handling: During the interoperability process between Cangjie and ArkTS, various exceptions may occur, such as call errors or runtime errors. This function is used to capture these exceptions for error handling, ensuring the program remains stable in the event of an exception or provides appropriate error prompts.
- Object Lifecycle Management: Manages the entire lifecycle of objects involved in interoperability, including creation, usage, and destruction, ensuring objects are managed correctly at appropriate times, avoiding memory leaks, and ensuring the efficiency and stability of memory usage in the program.
- Runtime Management: Responsible for the relevant management of interoperability code during execution, such as configuring the runtime environment, resource scheduling during the execution process, performance monitoring, etc., ensuring that the generated interoperability code can be efficiently and stably executed in the target runtime environment.Explanation of the imported components in the architecture diagram:- cangjie_compiler: Provides the capability to compile and build HLE tools.


## Directory Structure

The source code directory of `HLE` is structured as follows, with main functionalities described in the comments:

```
hyperlangExtension/
|-- build                       # Build scripts
|-- doc                         # Documentation
|-- src                         # Source code
    |-- dtsparser               # ArkTS interface file parser
    |-- entry                   # ArkTS-to-Cangjie interface converter
    |-- tool                    # Utility classes for the conversion process
|-- tests                       # Test cases
```

## Installation and Usage Guide:

### Build Preparation

Below is a build guide for Ubuntu 22 environment.

1. Download and extract the latest Cangjie package, then configure the Cangjie environment:

`HLE` requires the following tools for building:

- `Cangjie SDK`
    - Developers need to download the `Cangjie SDK` for the target platform: For compiling native platform artifacts, use the SDK version matching the current platform; for cross-compiling Windows artifacts from Linux, use the Linux version of the SDK.
    - Then, execute the `envsetup` script of the corresponding SDK to ensure proper configuration.
- `stdx` binary library compatible with the `Cangjie SDK`
    - Download the `stdx` binary library for the target platform. For cross-compiling Windows artifacts from Linux, use the Windows version of `stdx`.
    - Configure the `stdx` binary library path to the environment variable `CANGJIE_STDX_PATH`, pointing to the `static/stdx` directory under the extracted library.
    - Alternatively, to use `stdx` dynamic libraries as dependencies, replace `static` with `dynamic` in the path configuration. Note that `HLE` compiled this way cannot run independently unless the same `stdx` library path is added to the system's dynamic library environment variables.
- For building with `python` scripts, install `python3`.

2. This tool requires Node.js for execution:

    Recommended version: v18.14.1 or higher. Lower versions may fail to parse certain ArkTS syntax, so using the latest version is advised.

    [How to Install Node.js](https://dev.nodejs.cn/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/)

    For example, use the following commands:
    
    ```sh
    # Download and install nvm:
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
    # in lieu of restarting the shell
    \. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
    # Download and install Node.js:
    nvm install 22
    # Verify the Node.js version:
    node -v # Should print "v22.17.1".
    nvm current # Should print "v22.17.1".
    # Verify npm version:
    npm -v # Should print "10.9.2".
    ```

### Build Steps

1. Clone this project:

    ```sh
    git clone https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_tools.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    Install TypeScript dependencies, which include the TypeScript compiler, by running:

    ```sh
    cd {WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/hyperlangExtension/src/dtsparser
    npm install
    ```

3. Compile `hle` using the build script in `hyperlangExtension/build`:

    ```shell
    cd cangjie-tools/hyperlangExtension/build
    python3 build.py build -t release
    ```

    Currently supported build types are `debug` and `release`, specified via `-t` or `--build-type`.

4. Install to a specified directory:

    ```shell
    python3 build.py install
    ```

    By default, this installs to `hyperlangExtension/target`. Use the `--prefix` parameter to specify an alternative directory:

    ```shell
    python3 build.py install --prefix ./output
    ```

    The output directory structure is:

    ```
    output/
    |-- hle                         # Executable (hle.exe on Windows)
    ```

5. Verify `hle` installation:

    ```shell
    ./hle -h
    ```

    Execute this in the installation directory. If the help information for `hle` is displayed, the installation is successful.

    To use the binary file directly:

    ```sh
    ${WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/hyperlangExtension/output/hle -i input_file_path -o output_folder --lib
    ```

    Example:

    ```sh
    ${WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/hyperlangExtension/output/hle  -i  ${WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/hyperlangExtension/tests/cases/class.d.ts -o out --module-name=ohos.hilog --lib
    ```

    On Windows, file paths must use forward slashes (`/`) instead of backslashes (`\`):
    ```sh
    ${WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/hyperlangExtension/output/hle.exe -i  ${WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/hyperlangExtension/tests/cases/class.d.ts -o out --module-name=ohos.hilog --lib
    ```

6. Clean build artifacts:

   ```shell
   python3 build.py clean
   ```

Cross-compiling `hle` for Windows from Linux is also supported:

```shell
export CANGJIE_HOME=${WORKDIR}/cangjie
python3 build.py build --target windows-x86_64
python3 build.py install --prefix output
```

The build artifacts will be located in `hyperlangExtension/output`.

### Additional Build Options

`build.py` provides the following additional options for the `build` command:
- `--target TARGET`: Specify the target platform (default: `native`). Currently, only cross-compiling `windows-x86_64` artifacts from `linux` is supported via `--target windows-x86_64`;
- `-t, --build-type BUILD_TYPE`: Specify build type (`debug` or `release`);
- `-h, --help`: Display help information for the `build` command.

Other `build.py` functionalities include:

- `install [--prefix PREFIX]`: Install build artifacts to a specified path (default: `hyperlangExtension/target/`). Requires successful `build` execution first;
- `clean`: Remove build artifacts from the default path;
- `-h, --help`: Display general help information for `build.py`.
