# Cangjie Project Manager Developer Guide

## System Architecture

`cjpm` is a project management tool for cangjie language, implemented in Cangjie language. It is designed to simplify user workflows. `cjpm` provides capabilities for project creation, project building, project execution, unit testing, and more. The overall architecture of this tool is illustrated as follows:

![cjpm Architecture Diagram](../figures/cjpm-architecture.jpg)

As shown in the architecture diagram, the overall structure of `cjpm` is as follows:

- Command-line Argument Processing: The command-line argument processing module of `cjpm` supports project initialization, compilation and building, output execution, test case execution, dependency printing, dependency updates, output installation and uninstallation, and output cleanup via commands.
- Configuration Management: Users can configure various settings via the `cjpm.toml` configuration file, including project information, dependency configurations, platform isolation settings, and workspace configurations. `cjpm` also performs checks to ensure the validity of these configurations.
- Dependency Management: `cjpm` manages user-configured source dependencies, including configuration validity checks, incremental identification, configuration updates and parsing, and configuration display. It also supports configuring binary dependencies for C and Cangjie languages, along with command-line dependency printing.
- Project Building: `cjpm` automates dependency parsing to generate package-level dependency graphs. It then invokes the Cangjie compiler to compile packages in dependency order, completing the project build. `cjpm` supports parallel and incremental compilation.
- Project Testing: `cjpm` supports compiling test code within projects and running unit tests. It supports both single-package testing and module-level testing.
- Compiler Integration Module: This module facilitates interaction with the Cangjie compiler, implementing imperative compiler invocation and result forwarding.

Note that `cjpm` is a package management tool for the Cangjie project, and its product types are static libraries, dynamic libraries, and executable binary. To complete the HAP/APP build and packaging of OpenHarmony, it is also necessary to use the DevEco Hvigor tool provided by DevEco Studio.

```

## Installation and Usage Guide

### Build Preparation

`cjpm` requires the following tools for building:

- `cangjie SDK`
    - Developers need to download the `cangjie SDK` for the corresponding platform: To compile native platform artifacts, the `SDK` version must match the current platform; to cross-compile `Windows` platform artifacts from a `Linux` platform, the `SDK` must be the `Linux` version.
    - Then, developers must execute the `envsetup` script of the corresponding `SDK` to ensure proper configuration.
    - If using the `python` build script method, developers can use a self-compiled `cangjie SDK`. Refer to [cangjie SDK](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_build) for compiling `cangjie SDK` from source.
- `stdx` binary library compatible with `cangjie SDK`
    - Developers need to download the `stdx` binary library for the target platform or compile it from `stdx` source code: To compile native platform artifacts, the `stdx` library must match the current platform; to cross-compile `Windows` platform artifacts from a `Linux` platform, the `stdx` library must be the `Windows` version.
    - Then, developers must configure the `stdx` binary library path in the environment variable `CANGJIE_STDX_PATH`. If downloading pre-built `stdx` binaries, the path is the `static/stdx` directory under the extracted library directory; if compiling from `stdx` source, the path is the `static/stdx` directory under the corresponding platform directory in the `target` output directory (e.g., `target/linux_x86_64_cjnative/static/stdx` for `Linux-x86`). Refer to [stdx Repository](https://gitcode.com/Cangjie/cangjie_stdx) for compiling `stdx` from source.
    - Additionally, if developers want to use `stdx` dynamic libraries as binary dependencies, they can replace `static` with `dynamic` in the above path configuration. `cjpm` compiled this way cannot run independently; to enable standalone execution, the same `stdx` library path must be added to the system dynamic library environment variables.
- If using the `python` build script method, install `python3`.

### Build Steps

#### Build Method 1: Using `cjpm` for Compilation

The `cjpm` source code itself is a `cjpm` module. Therefore, the `cjpm` in `cangjie SDK` can be used to compile `cjpm` source code. After configuring the `SDK` and `stdx`, developers can compile using the following command:

```
cd ${WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/cjpm
cjpm build -o cjpm
```

The compiled `cjpm` executable directory structure is as follows:

```
// Linux/macOS
cjpm/target/release/bin
`-- cjpm

// Windows
cjpm/target/release/bin
`-- cjpm.exe
```

Currently, the `cjpm.toml` in the source repository supports compiling `cjpm` for the following platforms:
- `Linux/macOS` with `x86/arm` architecture;
- `Windows x86`.

Additionally, to cross-compile `Windows` platform artifacts from a `Linux` system, use the following command:

```
cd ${WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/cjpm
cjpm build -o cjpm --target x86_64-w64-mingw32
```

The compiled `cjpm` executable directory structure is as follows:

```
cjpm/target/x86_64-w64-mingw32/release/bin
`-- cjpm.exe
```

#### Build Method 2: Using Build Script for Compilation

Developers can use the build script `build.py` in the `build` directory to compile `cjpm`. To use `build.py`, developers can either configure `cangjie SDK` and `stdx` libraries or use self-compiled `cangjie SDK` and `stdx`.

The build process is as follows:

1. Compile `cjpm` using the build script `build.py` in the `cjpm/build` directory:

    ```shell
    cd ${WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/cjpm/build
    python3 build.py build -t release [--target native]        (for Linux/Windows/macOS)
    python3 build.py build -t release --target windows-x86_64  (for Linux-to-Windows)
    ```

    Developers must specify the build type with `-t, --build-type`, with options being `debug/release`.

    After successful compilation, the `cjpm` executable will be generated in the `cjpm/dist/` directory.

2. Modify environment variables:

    ```shell
    export PATH=${WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/cjpm/dist:$PATH     (for Linux/macOS)
    set PATH=${WORKDIR}/cangjie-tools/cjpm/dist;%PATH%       (for Windows)
    ```

3. Verify `cjpm` installation:

    ```shell
    cjpm -h
    ```

    If the help information for `cjpm` is displayed, the installation is successful.

> **Note:**
>
> On `Linux/macOS` systems, developers can configure the `runtime` dynamic library path in `rpath` so that the compiled `cjpm` can locate the `runtime` dynamic library without relying on system dynamic library environment variables:
> - When using `cjpm` for compilation, add the `--set-runtime-rpath` compile option to `cjc` to ensure the compiled `cjpm` can locate the `runtime` dynamic library of the current `cangjie SDK`. Add this option to the `compile-option` field in `cjpm.toml` to apply it to the `cjc` compile command.
> - When using the `build.py` script, specify the `rpath` path with the `--set-rpath RPATH` parameter.
> - In `cangjie SDK`, the `runtime` dynamic library directory is located under `$CANGJIE_HOME/runtime/lib`, divided into subdirectories by platform. Use the corresponding platform's library directory for `rpath` configuration.

### Additional Build Options

The `build` function of `build.py` provides the following additional options:
- `--target TARGET`: Specifies the target platform for compilation (default: `native`). Currently, only cross-compiling `windows-x86_64` artifacts from `linux` is supported via `--target windows-x86_64`.
- `--set-rpath RPATH`: Specifies the `rpath` path.
- `-t, --build-type BUILD_TYPE`: Specifies the build type (`debug/release`).
- `-h, --help`: Displays help information for the `build` function.

Additionally, `build.py` provides the following extra functionalities:
- `install [--prefix PREFIX]`: Installs build artifacts to the specified path (default: `cjpm/dist/`). Requires successful execution of `build` first.
- `clean`: Cleans build artifacts in the default path.
- `-h, --help`: Displays help information for `build.py`.

## API and Configuration Guide

`cjpm` provides the following main commands and `toml` configuration files for project building and configuration management.

### Command Overview

Executing `cjpm -h` displays the command list for `cjpm`, as shown below:

Use "cjpm [subcommand] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Key commands are described below:

1. `init` command:
    - Initializes a new Cangjie module or workspace. For modules, it creates a `cjpm.toml` configuration file and a `src` directory by default. For workspaces, it only creates `cjpm.toml` and scans existing Cangjie modules to populate the `members` field. Skips file creation if `cjpm.toml` or `main.cj` already exists.

2. `build` command:
    - Builds the current Cangjie project. Dependency checks are performed before invoking `cjc` for compilation.

3. `run` command:
    - Executes the compiled binary artifact of the current Cangjie project. Implicitly runs the `build` command to generate the executable.

4. `clean` command:
    - Cleans build artifacts of the current Cangjie project.

### Configuration Management

The module configuration file `cjpm.toml` defines basic information, dependencies, compile options, etc. `cjpm` primarily parses and executes based on this file.
